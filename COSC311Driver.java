/**
 * This will be the main driver program for many of your programs. Specifically,
 * you will need to define a data structure and related algorithms to use with this program.
 * We will be using the data file I have provied for you: a file of 68 records. Each record is composed
 * of three fields:
 *      String lastName
 *      String firstName
 *      String ID
 * ID may be implemented as an integer, but it is easier to implement as a string. Both lastName and firstName
 * may not be unique, but the ID **is** unique.

Yes sir, I implemented a delete method in my program for bonus points. Thank you*/
